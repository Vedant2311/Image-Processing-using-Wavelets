# Wavelets-and-Pyramids
Implemented Haar Wavelets and Lifting scheme for Image Compression and Denoising, along with Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids. Kindly refer to the corresponding directories for the same to get more information about them. This system majorly performs the tasks of Denoising, Image compression, and Image blending.
